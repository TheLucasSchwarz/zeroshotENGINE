# zeroshot-engine

A open-source scientific zero-shot text classification engine based on various LLM models.

### 📖 Description

This project provides a flexible framework for performing zero-shot classification using large language models and pandas. It allows you to classify text into categories without requiring explicit training data for those categories. All instructions to LLMs are provided by mere natural language prompts. The framework is designed to support a wide range of text classification tasks including multi-label, multi-class, and single-class classification scenarios.

### 🎯 Purpose

This package was developed as part of an academic research project to systematically classify political communication. The primary goal was to create an easy-to-use and accessible framework for building adaptable zero-shot classifications with large language models (LLMs) across a wide variety of text analysis tasks. By providing a flexible and intuitive tool, this project aims to empower students and researchers — especially those in social sciences — to explore, evaluate, and harness the potential of zero-shot classification while addressing its challenges in a user-friendly environment. I have no financial interest in this project.

### 🌍 Open-Source and Non-Commercial

This project is fully open-source and was developed with no financial interests. It is intended to support academic research and the broader scientific community. Contributions are welcome to help improve the framework and expand its capabilities.

## ✨ Features

*   Handles multi-label, multi-class, and single-class classification tasks.
*   Option for incorporating few-shot learning through the flexible prompt engineering approach.
*   Supports multiple LLM models (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama).
*   Easy-to-use command-line interface for demo purposes.
*   Customizable prompts.
*   Integration with pandas for data handling.

### 💡 Key Concepts

*   **Zero-Shot Learning:** The ability of a model to make predictions on unseen classes or tasks without prior training on those specific classes or tasks. The system learns entirely through natural language instructions, eliminating the need for labeled examples or fine-tuning.
*   **Sequential Classification:** A process where tasks are performed in a series of steps without strict dependencies (IDZSC approach).
*   **Hierarchical Classification:** A structured approach that breaks down complex classification tasks into a series of simpler decisions following a predefined hierarchy with explicit dependencies (HDZSC approach).
*   **Multi-Prompting:** The use of multiple different prompts for different tasks to elicit more comprehensive and reliable predictions from the model.
*   **Modular Prompt Design:** While not automated in the current implementation, the modular prompt design with text blocks facilitates manual testing and refinement of prompts to improve classification accuracy.

## 🚀 Get Started

```bash
pip install zeroshot-engine
```

### Interactive Demo directly in your the command line
Test the zeroshotENGINE in the HDZSC-scenario by  from a wide variety of LLMs and bring your own text
```bash
zeroshot-engine demo
```

### Usage

```bash
zeroshot-engine --help
```

## 🧩 Core Modules

### Iterative Double Validated Zero-Shot Classification (IDZSC)

IDZSC is the core module to classify texts in an iterative process. It can use a double validation technique to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the classifications.

### Hierarchical Double Validated Zero-Shot Classification (HDZSC)

HDZSC extends the zero-shot classification capabilities to hierarchical category structures. It leverages a double validation approach to maintain accuracy while navigating the complexities of hierarchical classification.
